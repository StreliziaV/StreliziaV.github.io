									<h2 id="Tech"><a>How<br />
									Computer Vision<br />
									Works</a></h2>
								</header>
								<article>
									<p>
										Computer vision needs lots of data which comes from image processing and feature extraction.
									</p>
									<p>
										Then it runs analysis of those data over and over until it discerns 
										distinctions and ultimately recognize images. For example, to train a computer to recognize 
										bicycle, it needs to be fed vast quantities of bicycle images and other related items like 
										motorcycle to learn the differences and recognize a bicycle.
									</p>
									<p>
										These processes involves many math and statistical method. 
										There are PCA and LDA for feature extraction processs. Also, deep learning and convolutional neural network (CNN)
										play an important role in image recognization and classification.
									</p>
									<p>
										The following sections show a demo of the image recognization process.
									</p>

										<h2><a>Digital Image<br />
										Acquisition</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/RGB.JPG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										First, various photosensitive cameras, including
										remote sensing equipment, X-ray tomography, radar, etc, are needed to capture a digital image
									</p>
									<p>
										The digital image can be represented in different format, 
										such as RGB, YUV, or CMY for the convenience of the following operations. 
										It can also be reprented by various physical data, such as the depth, absorbance or reflectance of sound waves, 
										electromagnetic waves or nuclear magnetic resonance.

										<h2><a>Digital Image<br />
										Pre-Process</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/process.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										Before implementing the feature extraction, one or some preprocessing is often used to  
										aid computational feasibility of subsequent processes. 
									</p>
									<p>
										These process may include Contrast Enhancement, Histogram Equalisation, Noise Reduction, 
										or Edge Extraction. It depends on the specific demand of different computer vision system.

										<h2><a>Feature<br />
										Extraction</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/PCA.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										After getting the row data, features such as the structural information, luminance, chrominance 
										will be extracted by applying analysis methods.
									</p>
									<p>
										Principle Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to reduce the dimension of the row data,
										and extract the most significant features among a digital image. In addition, Local Binary Patterns
										 (LBP) and Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA) are also efficient method to do the feature extraction.
										while PCA and LBP don't use any class information, LDA is a satisfactory method for classification.

										<h2><a href="#">Classification<br />
										and<br />
										Recognization</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/class.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										This is the step to make decision and is the most complicated part among the whole process.
										Based on the feature vectors extracted before, the system will ultimately do the classification 
										and recognization on the input data, and transform the result to the upper system.
									</p>
									<p>
										Common methods to accomplish this task include Linear Decision Function within feature space, 
										Minimum-Distance Classifiers, and Template Matching, etc.
									</p>
									<p>
										However, there are several shortcomings of the common methods such as the time cost and accuracy.
										Nowadays, Deep Learning and Neural Networks methods are essential for this work, which enable the 
										computer to recognize a image with neural system similar to human being.
